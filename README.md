## About

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is crucial for effective treatment and management. VocalPredict offers a non-invasive and cost-effective solution by analyzing vocal patterns to detect the disease in its early stages.

## Features

- Implementation of various machine learning models for Parkinson's disease detection.
- Feature selection using chi-square to reduce the number of data columns.
- Visualization of model performance using AUC graphs, confusion matrices, and training accuracy and loss plots.
- Comparison of model performance to select the best-performing algorithm.

## Installation

To get started with VocalPredict, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VocalPredict.git
cd VocalPredict
pip install -r requirements.txt
